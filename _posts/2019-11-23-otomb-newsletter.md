The Omega Beta chapter at Hofstra University has been growing
immensely in their leadership, professionalism, and standing on campus.
From working within their chapter to ensure growth in professionalism
and brotherhood, to extending to the community around them, this
chapter has been able to be a growing presence on their campus.  

Their commitment is inevitable though their accomplishments thus far
in the semester. This semester this chapter has been able to engage with
other chapters and colonies in their surrounding area and build
relationships with these brothers. They have been able to interact with
alumni and keep those connections alive through multiple events such as
their Vineyard Retreat, and Founders Day dinner. Through all the
events that have been held and that are upcoming, this chapter
continues to flourish in their connections and fellowship.

# NME Process Fall 2019
This semester brother Nikos Stathopoulos is
working as New Member Educator, and brother
Eduardo Guzman as New Member Educator
Assistant. Together, they have been working to
coordinate the weekly meetings that are held for
the new potential members and making sure that
they are well prepared for their national test.
This semester the chapter has a total of five
potential new members. First is Angelique, a
freshman bioengineering student. Elya, a
sophomore mechanical engineering student.
William, a sophomore mechanical engineering
student. Luke, a sophomore mechanical
engineering student. And lastly, we have Youssef
a Junior majoring in computer Science. This
semester Nikos and Eduardo have been working
tirelessly to keep the potential new members
engaged in the process while still conveying all of
the information necessary for them to be well
prepared and knowledgeable on fraternity
information. We are very excited to see how the
potential new members develop their
professional skills through this process and to see
how they grow individually!

"“A lot of the events and the interviews that we’ve
had to do really showed a whole different side to
Theta Tau that I never really got to see. The
interviews really have made me form some
connections with people and know them more
than just a name which is really nice and
unexpected. And the most important thing and
the thing that’s keeping me the most excited and
still happy is my pledge class, we all love each
other’s company, we put in so much effort to keep
each together happy and I do appreciate that a
lot. The bonds I’m making are really nice. I’m
glad to be doing this.”

# Regional Conference
This year the Regional Conference was held on
November 7-9, in Boston Massachusetts. This
conference gives surrounding chapters the
opportunity to come together for a weekend of
professional growth and allows them to grow in
fellowship with other chapters. Previously
brothers have attended and were able to return
with great insight on ways to efficiently run
chapters and better techniques that can be
applied to the fraternity’s’ structure. These
conferences are very helpful especially in the
development of a fraternity. The Omega Beta
chapter brothers were very excited to attend and
received great insight from the speakers there, we
are working on implementing everything that
they received from this conference to develop our
fraternity even further!
