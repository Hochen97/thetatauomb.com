<h1>Fall 2019 Newsletter!</h1>
The Omega Beta chapter at Hofstra University has been growing
immensely in their leadership, professionalism, and standing on campus.
From working within their chapter to ensure growth in professionalism
and brotherhood, to extending to the community around them, this
chapter has been able to be a growing presence on their campus.  

Their commitment is inevitable though their accomplishments thus far
in the semester. This semester this chapter has been able to engage with
other chapters and colonies in their surrounding area and build
relationships with these brothers. They have been able to interact with
alumni and keep those connections alive through multiple events such as
their Vineyard Retreat, and Founders Day dinner. Through all the
events that have been held and that are upcoming, this chapter
continues to flourish in their connections and fellowship.
